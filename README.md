This is framework for ongoing ML R&D studies for the ttbar+MET 1L analysis.

To get the repository execute (mayeb check you global config before with git config --list):
git clone ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/dhandl/stop1l-MLkit.git

cd stop1l-MLkit
source setup.sh (this command will eventually not work for you!)

More info will follow.

# This is framework for ongoing ML R&D studies for the ttbar+MET 1L analysis.

### Getting started

Maybe check your global config before with 
```
git config --list
```

```
git clone ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/dhandl/stop1l-MLkit.git
cd stop1l-MLkit
source setup.sh #(this command will eventually not work for you!)
```

More info will follow.
